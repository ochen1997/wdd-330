    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <p>Some of the summaries of what I have gained through reading the material this week include the following,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you write an application, you are communicating to the user.</li>
        <li>For there to be true communication, the user needs some way to speak to you.</li>
        <li>An application needs to be designed to store what is done, in order to be accessed when a device shuts down.</li>
        <li>The information stored or shared with the user is called <em>Output</em></li>
        <li>Anything that the user enters is called <em>Input</em>.</li>
        <li>When you want to get the user's input and textarea we use <em>value</em></li>
        <li>If the user wants to save anything and edit or add to it when they leave the page, the code that stores the information is <em>localStorage</em>.</li>
        <li>JavaScript <em>localStorage</em> uses <em>key-value</em> pairs.</li>
        <li>When making choices to talk to the user we use <em>Comparison Operator</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When it comes to designing Content, we need to start with a mobile-first approach that will lead to <em>Simple beautiful apps</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobile-first provides the best experience across many devices.</li>
        <li>Address restriction to size/bandwidth.</li>
        <li>Future Friendly and ready for growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <p>Why did you leave out defer when referencing JavaScript.</p>
