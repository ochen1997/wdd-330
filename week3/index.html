    <h1>Week 3 notes</h1>
    <p>
      An object literal in JavaScript is a self contained set related values and
      functions. They act as a collection of named properties that map to any
      Javascript value such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and functions.
      if a property value is a function know as method.
    </p>
    <p>
      An object iteral is an object that is created directly in the language by
      wrapping its properties in curly braces {}. Object literals are a
      distingushing features of the JavaScript language, as they allow objects
      tobe created quickly without need for defining a class.
    </p>
    <p>To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces.</p>
    <p>
      You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation, this
      will return a avalue of that property.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>superman.name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can also access an object's properties using bracket notation, the
      property is represented by a string inside square brackets, so need to be
      placed inside single or double quotation marks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>superman['name']</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To call an object's method we can also use dot or bracket notation.
      calling a method is the same as invoking a function, do parentheses need
      to be placed after the method name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>in</strong> operator can be used to check wether an object has
      aparticular property.
    </p>
    <p>Another way is to use <strong>hasOwnProperty()</strong>method.</p>
    <p>
      We can loop through all of an object's properties and methods by using a
      for in loop, eg;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (const key in superman){ console.log(key + ":" + superman[key]); }
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      New properties and and methods can be added to objects at anytime in a
      program. this is done simply by assigning avalue to the new property. for
      example;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>superman.city = 'Metropolis'; output: 'Metropolis'</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can change the value of an object's properties at anytime using
      assignment. for example we can the value of the "real name" like this.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>superman['real name'] = 'kal-El'; output: 'kal-El'</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any property can be removed from an object using the delete operator. for
      example if we wanted to remove the fly method from the superman object, we
      would enter the following.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>delete superman.fly output: true</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is even possible for an object to contain other objects. Thes are know
      as nested objects. For example.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        const jla = { superman: {realName: 'Clark kent'}, batman: {realName:
        'Bruce Wayne'}, wonderWoman: {realName: 'Diana Prince'}, flash:
        {realName: 'Barry Allen'}, aquaman: {realName: 'Arthur Curry'}, }
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function. This is
      useful when there are a large number of parameters, as it allows the
      arguments to be provided by name and in any order. for example;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        function greet(greeting, name, age){ return `${greeting}! My name is
        ${name} and i am ${age} years old.`; }
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      JavaScript has anumber of other built in global objects that can be
      accessed from anywhere in a program, They provide anumber of useful
      properties and methods.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a
        JavaScript object.
      </li>
      <li>
        The stringfy() method does the opposite, taking a Javascript object and
        returning a string of JSON data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The math object has eigth properties that represent a maix of commonly
      used math constants
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Math.PI</li>
      <li>Math.SQRT2 // square root of 2</li>
      <li>Math.SQRT_2 // recieprocal of the square root of 2</li>
      <li>Math.E // Euler's constant</li>
      <li>Math.LN2 // Natural logarithm of 2</li>
      <li>Math.LN10 // Natural logarithm of 10</li>
      <li>Math.LOG2E // Log base 2 of Euler's constant</li>
      <li>Math.LOG10E // Log base 10 of Euler's constant</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The math object also has several methods to carry out a variety of usefull
      mathematical operations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Math.abs()</li>
      <li>Math.ceil()</li>
      <li>Math.floor()</li>
      <li>Math.round()</li>
      <li>Math.trunc()</li>
      <li>Math.exp()</li>
      <li>Math.pow()</li>
      <li>Math.sqrt()</li>
      <li>Math.cbrt()</li>
      <li>Math.hypot()</li>
      <li>Math.log2()</li>
      <li>Math.log10</li>
      <li>Math.max()</li>
      <li>Math.min()</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Date object contain information about dates and time. Each object
      represents a single moment in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A constractor is used to create a new date object using the new operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The properties odf date object are unable to be viewed or changed
      directly. instead they have a number of methods known as getter methods,
      which returns information about the date object, such as month and year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The getDay() and getUTCDay() methods are used to find the day of the week
      thta the date object falls on. it returns a number, string at 0 for
      sunday, up to 6 for Saturday;
    </p>
    <p>
      The getDate() and getUTCDate() methods retuns the day of the month for the
      date object (note that these values start counting from 1, not 0 so they
      return the actual day of the month)
    </p>
    <p>
      The getMonth() and getUTCMonth() methods canbe used to find the month of
      the date object it returns an integer, but remember to count from 0; so
      january is 0 Febuary is 1 and so on up to december being 11.
    </p>
    <p>
      The getFullYear() and getUTCFullYear() methods return the year of the date
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model represents an HTML document as a network of
      connected nodes that fornm a tree like structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DOM treats everything on a web page as a node. HTML tags, the text
      inside these tags, even the atrributes of a tag are all nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DOM provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a
      page. These methods will return a node object or node list, which is an
      array like object. These objects can then be assigned to a variable and be
      inspected or modified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The getElementById() method does exactly what it says on the tin. it
      returns a reference to the element with a unique id atribute thta is given
      as an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The getElementByTagName() will return a live node list of all the elements
      with the tag name that is provided as an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The getElementByClassName() will return a live node list of all elements
      that have the class name that is supplied as an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document. querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to
      find the first element in the document that matches a CSS selector
      provided as an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns
      a node of list odf all the elements in the document that match the CSS
      query selector.
    </p>
    <p>
      The getAttribute() method returns the value of the attribute provided as
      an assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remove() method will remove as specific class from an element. For
      example, we could remove the class of 'warrior' with the following code.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>wonderWoman.ClassList.remove('warrior')</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The toggle method is aparticularly useful method that will add a class idf
      an element does not have it already, and remove the class if it does have
      it for example,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>wonderWoman.ClassList.toggle('hero') output: false</li>
      <li>wonderWoman.ClassList.toggle('sport') output: true</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any CSS property names that is seperated by dashes must be written in
      camelCase notation, so the dash is removed and the next letter is
      capitalized becuase dashes are not legal characters in property names.
    </p>
    <p>
        The recommended way of of dealing with events, and current standards, is to use event listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
        The addEventListner() method is called on a node object, the node to which the event is being applied.for example
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>document.body.addEventListener('click', doSomething);</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There several Types of Events, ranging from when a video has finished playing to when a resource has completed downloading.
