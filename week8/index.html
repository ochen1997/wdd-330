    <h1>Week 8 notes</h1>
    <p>
      The CSS3 transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/ or
      skew any element on the page. While some of these effects were possible
      using previously existing CSS features( such as translating with relative
      and absolute positioning) CSS3 gives you control over many more aspects of
      the element appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can manupulate an element's appearance using transform function. The
      value of the transform property is one or more transform functions that
      will be applied in the order they are provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Translation functions allow you to move elements left to right, up or
      down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative
      when declaring top or and left, moving elements up and down or left and
      right a long the x and y axes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trnaslate (x,y) function moves an element x from the left and y from
      the top. If you want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you
      can use the translatex or trnaslatey functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scale (x,y) functions scales an element by the defined factors
      horizontally or vertically. it will be used for both values of x and y.for
      example;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scale (1) would leave the element the same size</li>
      <li>Scale (2) would double its proportion</li>
      <li>Scale (0.5) would have them, and so on</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As with translate you can use the scale(x) or scale(y) functions. These
      functions will scale only the horizontal dimentions or only the vertical
      dimentions repectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rotate() function rotates an element a round the point of origin by a
      specified angle value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skew (x,y) funcetion specifies a skew a long the x and y axes. AS you
      had expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis and the y specifies the
      skew on the y axis. if the second parameter is omitted the skew will only
      occur on the x axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support older WebKit browsers you need to include the -webkit- prefix
      for all of your transition properties. -webkit-trnasform
    </p>
    <p>
      The trnasiton-duration property sets how long the transition will take:
      the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the
      transitioned state, you can specify this either in seconds or miliseconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition
      in even more granular detail.
    </p>
    <p>The most common timing functions include the ket terms;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ease</li>
      <li>linear</li>
      <li>ease-in</li>
      <li>ease-out</li>
      <li>ease-in-out</li>
      <li>
        The default ease has a slow start, then it speeds up, and ends with
        slow.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally by using the transition-delay property, its possible to introduce
      a delay before the transiton begins. Normally a transition bengin
      immediately, so the default is 0. include the number of milliseconds or
      seconds to delay transition.
