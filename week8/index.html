    <h1>Week 8 notes</h1>
    <p>
      The CSS3 transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/ or
      skew any element on the page. While some of these effects were possible
      using previously existing CSS features( such as translating with relative
      and absolute positioning) CSS3 gives you control over many more aspects of
      the element appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can manupulate an element's appearance using transform function. The
      value of the transform property is one or more transform functions that
      will be applied in the order they are provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Translation functions allow you to move elements left to right, up or
      down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative
      when declaring top or and left, moving elements up and down or left and
      right a long the x and y axes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trnaslate (x,y) function moves an element x from the left and y from
      the top. If you want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you
      can use the translatex or trnaslatey functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scale (x,y) functions scales an element by the defined factors
      horizontally or vertically. it will be used for both values of x and y.for
      example;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scale (1) would leave the element the same size</li>
      <li>Scale (2) would double its proportion</li>
      <li>Scale (0.5) would have them, and so on</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As with translate you can use the scale(x) or scale(y) functions. These
      functions will scale only the horizontal dimentions or only the vertical
      dimentions repectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rotate() function rotates an element a round the point of origin by a
      specified angle value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skew (x,y) funcetion specifies a skew a long the x and y axes. AS you
      had expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis and the y specifies the
      skew on the y axis. if the second parameter is omitted the skew will only
      occur on the x axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support older WebKit browsers you need to include the -webkit- prefix
      for all of your transition properties. -webkit-trnasform
    </p>
    <p>
      The trnasiton-duration property sets how long the transition will take:
      the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the
      transitioned state, you can specify this either in seconds or miliseconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition
      in even more granular detail.
    </p>
    <p>The most common timing functions include the ket terms;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ease</li>
      <li>linear</li>
      <li>ease-in</li>
      <li>ease-out</li>
      <li>ease-in-out</li>
      <li>
        The default ease has a slow start, then it speeds up, and ends with
        slow.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally by using the transition-delay property, its possible to introduce
      a delay before the transiton begins. Normally a transition bengin
      immediately, so the default is 0. include the number of milliseconds or
      seconds to delay transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text between the canvas tags will only be shown if the canvas element
      is not supported by the visitors browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the drawing of the canvas is used by javaScript, we will need a way
      to grab the element from the DOM, we will do so by giving our Canvas an
      id.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canvas element takes both a width and height attribute, which must
      also be set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally lets add a border to our canvas using some of the CSS to visually
      distinguish it on the page. Canvas has no default styling, so it is
      difficult to see where it is on the page unlesss you give it some kind of
      border
    </p>
    <p>All drawing on the canvas happens via the canvas JavaScript API.</p>
    <p>
      Once you have stored the Canvas element in avariable, we then set up the
      canvas context. The context is the olace where your drawing is rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      We obtain our drawing context by calling the getContext method and passing
      it the string "2d" since we will be drawing in two dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>Painting canvas is used by the following;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>strokeStyle</li>
      <li>fillStyle</li>
      <li>Both strokeStyle and fillStle are set on a context object.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We can draw a rectangle by calling the fillRect and strokeRect methods.
      Both of these methods take the x and the y coordinates, and the width and
      height of the rectangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use the API's toDataURL method to save our drawing. toDataURL
      creates a URL with the image in it. you can then rigth click the image at
      this URL and save it as a PNG or JPEG.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also draw images onto the canva selement,by ensuring element has
      loaded in order to do that we will add an event listner that run our code
      only once the window's load event has fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will add a new event listner to react to play event firing on the video
      element., we will call a custom function called draw when the video begins
      playing. tod do so ww will add an event listner to our video element thta
      responds to the play event.
    </p>
    <p>
      The draw function which is a custom function that we will define, will be
      called when the play event fires. it will be passed the video , context
      and canvas objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are using an anonymous function here instead of a normal named
      functions because we are unable to actually pass parameters to named
      functions when declaring the as event handlers without wrapping them in an
      a nother function.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an error occurs when trying to call getImageData it would be nice to
      let the user know what is going wrong. we will do just tha, using the
      fillText method of the Canvas API.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we write any text to the canvas, we should clear whats already
      there. We have already drawn the first frame of the video into the canvas
      using the call to drawImage. How can we clear that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that if we reset the width or height of the canvas, the
      canvas will be cleared, so lets reset the width.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next lets change the background color from black to transparent, since the
      canvas element is positioned on top of the video.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we can draw any text to the now transparent canvas, we first must
      set up the style of our text similar to what we did with paths earlier. we
      do that with the fillStyle and textAlign methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also set a specific font and font style we had like to use. THe
      font property of the context object works the same way the CSS font
      property does. We will specify a font size of 18px and comma separated
      list of font families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally we draw the text. we use a method of the context object called
      fillText which takes the text to be drawn and the x,y coordinates where it
      should be placed. Since we want to write out a fairly long messag, we will
      split it up into several section, placing each one on the canvas
      separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the last step, we return false. This lets us check in the draw function
      wether an exception was thrown. if it was, we want to stop calling
      drawOneFrame for each video frame, so we exit the draw function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing a circle with SVG is easier than drawing a circle with canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viewBox attribute defines the starting location width, and height of
      the SVG image. The circle element defines a circle with cx and cy the x
      and y coordinates of the center of the circle. The redius is represented
      by r while fill defines the fill style.
    </p>
    <p>
      To view an SVG file you simply open it via the file menu in any browser
      that supports SVG.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also draw rectangles in SVG and add a sroke to them as we did with
      canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we populate the rect tag with a number of attributes that describes
      the rectangle. This includes the x and y coordinate where the rectangle
      should be drawn, the width and height of the rectangle, the fill the
      stroke and the width of the stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much as with canvas, you can draw images into a container that you create
      using Raphael. lets add a div to our main index file. we will use this as
      a container for the SVG elements that we will create using Raphael. we
      have given this div the id of spinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have styled this div to be placed in the center of the parent mapDiv
      using CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in our geolocation javaScript .js, lets put the spinner in place while
      we are fetching the map. The first step is to turn our div into Raphael
      container. This is as simple as calling the raphael method, and passing in
      the element we had like to use a long with a width and height.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we draw the spinner SVG image into newly created container with the
      Raphael method image which is called on a Raphael container object. This
      method takes the path of the image, the starting coordinates where the
      image should be drawn and width and height of the image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final step is to call the animate method and specify how long the
      animation should last. In our case, we will let it run fo amaximum of 60
      seconds. Since animate takes its values in milliseconds we will pas it to
      60000.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now have a spinning progress indicator to keep our visitors in the know
      while our map is loading. There is still one problem, though it remains
      after the map has loaded. we can fix this by adding one line to the
      beginning of the existing displayOneMap function.
    </p>
    <p>
      This line sets the display property of the spinner element to none,
      effectively hiding the spinner div and the SVG image we have loaded into
      it.
