    <h1>Week 4 notes</h1>
    <p>
      The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an
      HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear
      in the markup. for example
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>const form = document.forms[0];</li>
      <li>const form = document.getElementByTagname('form')[0];</li>
      <li>
        Instead of using a numerical index, we can use the name attribute to
        identify a form eg; const form = document.forms.search;
      </li>
      <li>const forms = document['search'];</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A form objecy also has a method called elements that returns an HTML
      collection of all the elements contained in the form. in this case the
      form conatain two controls: an input element and a button element. for
      example;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>const [input, button] = form.elements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      we can also access the form controlls using their name attributes as if it
      was a property of the form object. for example.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>const input = form.searchInput</li>
      <li>const input = form['searchInput']</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically.note that
      submitting aform using this method wont trigger the form submit event.
    </p>
    <p>
      The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their
      initial values specified in the HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can actually stop the form from submitting to the url altogether by
      using the preventDefault() method.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        function search(event){ alert('Form Submitted'); event.preventDefault();
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some common form controls are;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        input field, including text, passwords, checkboxes, radio buttons, and
        file uploads
      </li>
      <li>select menus for drop down list options</li>
      <li>textarea elements for longer text entry.</li>
      <li>button elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The input element includes some of the new attributes introduced in HTML5.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>document.form.hero.heroName.focus();</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The placeholder attribute will insert the value property in the input
      field until the user enters some text.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maxlength attribute will limit numbers of characteristics that can be
      entered in the field to the value given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Form validation is the process of checking wether a user has entered the
      information into a form correctly. for example
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arequired field is completed</li>
      <li>An email email address is valid</li>
      <li>A number is entered when numerical number is required.</li>
      <li>A password is atleast a minimum number of characters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the
      server side. it is advisable to use both client side and server side
      validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Object oriented programing is often used to model representation of
      objects in the real world. There are three main concepts in oops;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>encapsulation</li>
      <li>polymorphism</li>
      <li>Inheritance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Encapsulation ivolves keeping all programming logic inside an object and
      making methods available to implement the functionallity.
    </p>
    <p>
      polymorphism this means various objects can share the same methods but
      also have ability to override shared methods with a more specific
      implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inheritance this means we can take an object that already exists and
      inherit all its properties and methods. we can then improve on its
      functionallity by adding new properties.
    </p>
    <p>class can be used to define a blue print for an object.</p>
    <p>
      All objects have a constructor property thta returns the constructor
      function that created it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The static keyword can be used in class declaration to create a static
      method.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model. This means that every
      class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      An object instance can overwrite any properties or methods inherited from
      its prototype by simply assigning a new value to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the
      class has been declared. it should be used to define any properties that
      will remain the same for every instance of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, an object's methods are public in Javascript. Methods and
      properties are said to be public because they can be queried directly and
      changed by assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Properties of objects in JavaScript are said to be enumerable or non
      enumerable. if they are not enumerable, this means they wll not show up
      when a for in loop is used to loop through an object's properties and
      methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      A class can inherit from another class using the extends keyword in the
      class declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept of polymorphism mean that different objects can have the same
      mehtod, but implement it in different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to add more methods to the prototype of javaScript's built
      in objects such as numbers, string and array to add more functionallity.
      This practice is known as monkey-patching.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to avoid using classes altogether and create new objects
      bases on another object that ac as a blueprint or prototype instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everytime a new object is created using the object.create() method, the
      new object inherits all the properties and methods from the parent objec,
      which becomes the new objects prototype.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to borrow methods from objects without having to inherit
      all their properties and methods. This is done by making a reference to
      the function that you want to borrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most common uses of borrowing methods was to borrow methods
      from arrays.
    </p>

      A javascript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that
      make it easier to achieve common tasks. Javascript is an extremely
      flexible language that can accomplish most programming task but not all
      undertaking are as easy to do as they should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      jQuery is the most popular of all the JavaScript libraries used todya as
      seen in these statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abig advantage of utilizing popular libraries is that it will be used by
      lots of people thoroughly tested
    </p>
    <p>
      A module is a self conatsined piece of code that provides functions and
      that can then be used in other files and by other modules. This helps to
      keep code organised in separate, reusable files which improves code
      maintainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Node.js had already implemented modules before they were introduced in
      ES6, and used a slightly different notation called Common js modules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Model view Controller is a design pattern thats been used for a long time
      in server side languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Models are object that implement the functionallity for creating, reading,
      updating and deleting specific pieces of information a bout the
      application as well as any other associated logic and behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Views provide a visual representation of the model showing all the
      relevant information. in a web application, this would be the HTML
      displayed on the page. Views also provide a way for users to interact with
      an application usually via forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Controllers link models and views together by communicating between them.
      They respond to events, which are usuallyinputs from user, process the
      information then update models and view accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An MVC architecture can take a lot of code to implement and many
      frameworks have emerged that take care of much of the setup code for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the main features of MVC frameworks is data binding, which is the
      process of linking the model and view together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aurella is amodern framework that uses ES6 and focuses on letting you
      write dynamic web applications while keeping the implementation detail in
      the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angular is a power framework by google to make creating dynamic web
      applications easier. this is done by extending the HTML langauge using
      custom -ng attributes
    </p>
    <p>
      Ember is a frame work designed to make building large web applications
      easier. it does this by using common conventions that avoid the need for
      lots of set up though it can be more difficult if you dont follow
      coventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are number of popular templating languages to chose from, a selection
      of some of the most popular are shown in the list below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Handlebars</li>
      <li>pug</li>
      <li>EJS</li>
      <li>Mustache</li>
      <li>Nunjuncks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The node package manager was developed soon after Node.js was introduced
      to allow Javascript code to be shared by developers. it has since grown
      into the largest repository of code libraries avaialable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to deploying your javascript program, its time to think a
      bout optimizing the code.

      Minification is the process of removing any unnecessary characters from
      your code to reduce the file size. This includes all comments, Whitespaces
      and other characteristics that are superflous.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tools available to do this, known as minifiers. some popular choices includes
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>YUI Compresser</li>
        <li>Google's Closure</li>
        <li>UglifyJS</li>
