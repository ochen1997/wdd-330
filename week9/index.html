      Every JavaScript environment has a global variable. Any variable that are
      created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and
      any functions are mthods of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which
      represent the browser window that contains a web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Browser Object Model is a collection of properties and methods that
      contain information about the browser and computer screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Global variables are variables that are created without using the const,
      let or var keywords. Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the
      program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Global varaibles are actuaul properties of a global object. In a browser
      environment, the globle objet is the window object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and

      is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the
      navigator object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The navigatorobject contains information about the browser being used.it
      is userAgent property will return information about the browser and
      operating systm being used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window.location property is an oblect that contains information about
      the URL of the current page. it contains a number of properties that
      provide information about different fragments of the URL. The URL property
      returns the full URL as a sring.

    </p>
    <p>
      The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the

    </p>
    <p>The search property returns a string that stsrts with with a "?"</p>
    <p>The hash property returns a string that starts with a "#"</p>
    <p>
      The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and the

    </p>
    <p>The window.location object has the following methods;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        reload() method- can be used to force a reload of the current page. if
        its given parameter of true.

    </p>
    <p>
      The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited

    </p>
    <p>
      The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where
      0 is the current page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be

    </p>
    <p>
      The data attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom
      attributes that are ignored by the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they
      must use the following format
    </p>
    <ul>

      </li>
      <li>Include an optional string value</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The HTML5 speifications contains a number of APIs that can help to gain
      access to hardware such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cameras</li>
      <li>batteries</li>
      <li>geolocation</li>
      <li>graphics card</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The web Storage API provides a key-value store on the clients computer
      that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage
      capacity, and generally easy to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a browser supports the web Storage API the window object will have ap
      property called localStorage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everytime a value is saved to the local storage a storage event is fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the
      device.
    </p>
    <p>
      If geolocation is available, it will be a property of the navaigator
      object. This property has a method called such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        getCurrentPosition()- that will return a position object ro as pecific
        callback function called youAreHere()
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The clearWatch() method can be used to stop the callback being called,
      using the ID of the watch as an argument
    </p>
    <p>
      The Geolocation API provides a useful interface for adding location based
      information to a wbsite or application
    </p>
    <p>
      The service worker API allows a worker script to run in the backgroundwith
      the added benefits of being able to intercept network requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML5 introduced the audio and vedio tags used to insert audio and video
      clips into a web page. it also introduced a media API for controlling the
      playback of the clips using JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      An audio clip can be inserted into a page with the audio tag, using the
      src attribure to point to the audio file
    </p>
    <p>
      Adio and Video elements have anumber of properties and methods to control
      the playback of the clip
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The play() method will start the clip by playing from its current
        position
      </li>
      <li>The pause() method will pausse the clip at its current position</li>
      <li>
        The volume property is anumber that can be used to set the audio volume
        - video.volume = 0.9;
      </li>
      <li>
        The muted property is a boolean value that can be used to mute the audio
      </li>
      <li>
        The currentTime property is a number value that can be used to jump to
        another part of the clip
      </li>
      <li>
        The playbackRate property is used to fast-forward or rewind the clip by
        changing its value
      </li>
      <li>
        The loop property is a boolean value that can be set to true to make the clip repeat in a loop.
      </li>
      <li>The duration property can be used to see how long the clip lasts.</li>
    </ul>
