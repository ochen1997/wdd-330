    <h1>Week 2 notes</h1>
    <p>
      Becoming a JavaScript programmer it is important to learn how to write
      comments, and these are the two types of writting comments
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Single comment, start with // and finishing at the end of the line
      </li>
      <li>Multiple line comments starting with /* and finishing with */</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is considered best practice to combine the two and write each statement
      on a new line, terminated by a semicolon. Javascript has seven premitive
      data types and are listed below;
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>sring</li>
      <li>symbol</li>
      <li>Numbers</li>
      <li>Boolean</li>
      <li>Undefined</li>
      <li>Null</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The keyword <strong>const</strong> is uesd when the variable will not be
      reassigned to another value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keyword <strong>let</strong> is used if the variable might be reassigned later
      in the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> to declare variables means they are
      block scope, so their values only exists inside the block they are
      declared in, scope is an important concept in programming. There are two
      types of scopes;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Global scope; declared outside of the block.</li>
      <li>Local scope; declared inside a block.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When naming constants and variables it is important to give them a
      sensible names that better describe what the variable represnts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constants and variable names can start with any upper or lower case
      letters, for example;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>firstName</li>
      <li>last_name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To call methods we use dot operator (.) followed by name of the method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temperal literal uses backtick (``) characters to determine strings, and
      has advantage of being able to use both types of quotemark with string.
    </p>
    <p>To creat a symbol we use <strong>symbol()</strong> method.</p>
    <p>
      Array are unorderd list of values,to create an array literal simply write
      apair of square.
    </p>
    <p>The delete operator will remove an item from an array.</p>
    <p>
      Destructing an array is the concept of taking values out of an array and
      presenting them as individaul value.
    </p>
    <p>To remove the last item from an array we we can use the pop() method.</p>
    <p>The shift() method removes the first item in the array.</p>
    <p>The push() method appends anew value to the end of the array.</p>
    <p>
      Logical conditons allows you to control the flow of a program by running
      different blocks of code, depending on the results of certain operations,
      example of logical conditions;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>if</li>
      <li>else</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Loops will repeat a piece of code over and over a gain according to
      acertain conditons.
    </p>
    <p>
      While loops will repeatedly run ablock of code while a certain condtion is
      true.
    </p>
    <p>To define a function literal we can use a function declaration.</p>
    <p>
      All functions return a value which can be specified using the return
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parameters and argumentments are terms that are often used interchangeably
      represent values provided for functions as inputs.
    </p>
    <p>Every function has a special variable called arguments.</p>
    <p>
      Default paremeters are values that will be used the function if no
      arguments are provided when it invoked for example;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        function hello(name = "world"){ console.log("hello ${name}"); hello()
        output "hello world"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Arrow functions make declarationfunctions more Succint by using less
      verbose syntax and the use single parameters.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>const square = x=> x*x</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a call
      back.
    </p>
