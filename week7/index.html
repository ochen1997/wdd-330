    <h1>Week 7 notes</h1>
    <p>
      The fact that functions are first class objects means they can have
      properties and methods themselves.for example, all functions have a length
      property that returns the number of parameters the function has.
    </p>
    <p>function square(X){ return x*x; }</p>
    <p>
      The call method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to
      an object that is provided as the first argument.for example,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>function sayHello(){ return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`; }</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We can create some objects that have a name property, then use the call()
      method to invoke the sayHello function , providing each object as an
      argument. This will then take the value of this in the function. for
      example
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>const clark = {name: 'clark'};</li>
      <li>const bruce = {name: 'Bruce'};</li>
      <li>sayHello.call(clark);</li>
      <li>Output: 'Hello, my name is Clark'</li>
      <li>sayHello.call(bruce)</li>
      <li>Output: 'Hello, my name is Bruce</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions in
      the same way that you can add properties to any object in Javascrip.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example you can add a description property to a function that
      describes what it does.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the
      result in a cache property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then if if the same argument is used again later, we can return the value
      of cache, rather than having to compute the result again. for example;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        function square(x){ square.cache = square.cache || {};
        if(!square.cache[x]){ square.cache[x] = x*x } return square.cache[x] }
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An immediate invoked function Function Expression is an anonymous functuin
      that, as the suggests, is invoked as soon as it is defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      This easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function
      definition, the function also has to be made into an expression, which is
      done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses as in this
      example.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(function(){
            const temp = 'World';
            console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);})()
        </li>
        <li>Output: 'Hello World'</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There is no way to remove variable from scope once it is been declared. if avariable is only required temporarily, it
