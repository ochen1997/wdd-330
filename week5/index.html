    <h1>Week 5 notes</h1>
    <p>
      Errors caused when something goes wrong in the program, They are usually
      caused by one of the following; caused by one of the following
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        System error-there is aproblem with the system or external devices with
        which the program is interacting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Programmer error-the program contains incorrect syntaxor fault logic; it
        could even be as simple as a typo
      </li>
      <li>
        User error-the user has entered data incorrectly which the program is
        unable to handle
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An exception is an error that is produces a return value that can be used
      by the program to deal with the error.
    </p>
    <p>
      An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of the
      functions or method calls that lead to the point where the erroe occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error
      occurred to identify the original function or method that started the
      sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warning can occur if there is an error in the code that is not enough to
      causethe program to crash. This means the program will continue to run
      after the warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and
      warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is due to the fact that strict mode considers coding practice that
      were previously accepted as just being poor style as actual errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debugging is the process of finding out where the bugs occur in the code
      and then dealing with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most basic form for debugging is to use the alert() method to show
      dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from
      running until ok is clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using alerts for debugging was the only option in the past, but Javascript
      development has progressed since then and their use is discouraged for
      debugging purposes today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most modern Javascript environments have a console object that provides a
      number of method for logging information and deburging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most modern browsers also have a debbuging tool that allows you to set
      breakpoints in your code that will pause it a certain points you can the
      see the valuesof all variables at those points and modify them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are the links to the debugger documentation for each of the major
      browsers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firefox</li>
      <li>Edge</li>
      <li>Chrome</li>
      <li>Safari</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create
      a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and
      allow you to see where the program is currently up to.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also hover over any variables to see what value they hold at that
      point.
    </p>
    <p>The program can then be restarted by clicking on the play button.</p>
    <p>
      An error Object can be created by the host environment when an exception
      occurs or it can be created in the code using a constructor function.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible to throw your own exception using the throw statement.
      This will allow for any problem in your code to be highlighted and dealt
      with rather than lurk quietly in the back ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throw statement can be applied to any Javascript expression, causing
      the excecution of the program to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to handle exception gracefully by catching the error. Any
      errors can be hidden from users , but still identified. we can then deal
      with the error appropriately perhaps even ignore it and keep the program
      running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked.
      Writting good test means your code will be less brittle as it develops and
      any errors will be identified early on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Test driven development is the process of writting tests before any actual
      code. Obviously these tests will initially fail, because there is no code
      to test.
    </p>
    <p>The next step is to write some code to make the tests pass.</p>
    <p>
      After this the code is refactored to make it faster, more readable and
      remove any repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code is continually tested at each stage to make sure it continues to
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process should be followed in small piecemeal chucks everytime a new
      feature is implemented, resulting in the following workflow.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write tests</li>
      <li>write code to pass the tests</li>
      <li>Refactor the code</li>
      <li>Test refactored code</li>
      <li>write more tests for new features</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is possible to write your own tests.</p>
    <p>
      Testing frameworks provide a structure to write meaning tests and then run
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are large number of frameworks available for Javascrip, but we will
      be focusing on the jest framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook that has gained a lot of
      popularity recently. it makes it easy to create and run tests by providing
      helper methods for common tests assertion.
